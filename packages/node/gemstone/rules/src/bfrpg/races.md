# Part 2: Player Characters

## Character Races

### Dwarves
#### Description 
Dwarves are a short, stocky race; both male
and female Dwarves stand around four feet tall and
typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long hair and
thick beards are dark brown, gray or black. They take
great pride in their beards, sometimes braiding or forking
them. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. Dwarves
have stout frames and a strong, muscular build. They are
rugged and resilient, with the capacity to endure great
hardships. Dwarves are typically practical, stubborn and
courageous. They can also be introspective, suspicious
and possessive. They have a lifespan of three to four
centuries.

#### Restrictions
Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or
Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Constitution 
of 9. Due to their generally dour dispositions,
they may not have a Charisma higher than 17. They may
not employ Large weapons more than four feet in length
(specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows).

#### Special Abilities
All Dwarves have Darkvision with a 60'
range, and are able to detect slanting passages, traps,
shifting walls and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6;
a search must be performed before this roll may be made.

#### Saving Throws
Dwarves save at +4 vs. Death Ray or
Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and
at +3 vs. Dragon Breath.

### Elves
#### Description
Elves are a slender race, with both genders
standing around five feet tall and weighing around 130
pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body or
facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears
and delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful. They
have keen eyesight and hearing. Elves are typically
inquisitive, passionate, self-assured, and sometimes
haughty. Their typical lifespan is a dozen centuries or
more.

#### Restrictions
Elves may become Clerics, Fighters, Magic-
Users or Thieves; they are also allowed to combine the
classes of Fighter and Magic-User, and of Magic-User and
Thief (see Combination Classes, below). They are
required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9. Due to their
generally delicate nature, they may not have a
Constitution higher than 17. Elves never roll larger than
six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.

#### Special Abilities
All Elves have Darkvision with a 60'
range. They are able to find secret doors more often than
normal (1-2 on 1d6 rather than the usual 1 on 1d6). An
Elf is so observant that one has a 1 on 1d6 chance to find
a secret door with a cursory look. Elves are immune to
the paralyzing attack of ghouls. Also, they are less likely to
be surprised in combat, reducing the chance of surprise by
1 in 1d6.

#### Saving Throws
Elves save at +1 vs. Paralysis or Petrify,
and +2 vs. Magic Wands and Spells.
