# Chapter I: Creating a Character

## Ability Scores

### Strength

Strength (“Str”) is a measure of physical power, and is the
most important attribute for fighters. If a fighter, pala-
din, or ranger character rolls an 18 strength, the player
then rolls a d%, and that number is added as a decimal,
or percentage, to the 18 strength. (See the table below
for details.) A roll of 00 on the percentage die indicates
a strength score of 19. Members of other classes cannot
naturally gain strength in excess of 18.

The following table summarises the bonuses and penalties
for strength scores. Note that an “Extraordinary Success”
indicates the possibility for extremely strong characters
to perform exceptional or normally impossible feats of
strength, such as opening a door which is held closed by
some relatively minor magic rather than a lock.

| Strength | Bonus to Hit | Bonus to Damage | Encumbrance Adjustment | Minor Tests | Major Tests |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 3        | -3           | -1              | -35                    | 1           | 0           |
| 4-5      | -2           | -1              | -25                    | 1           | 0           |

Minor Tests: e.g. forcing doors (chance on d6)  
Major Tests: e.g. bending bars and lifting portcullis (chance on d%)

### Dexterity
Dexterity (“Dex”) is a measure of the character’s speed,
hand-eye coordination, and nimbleness of foot. It affects
the accuracy of missile fire and the character’s ability to
dodge blows, so a high dexterity score can be extremely
useful to characters of any class. It is the most important
ability score for thieves.

Except in surprise situations, dexterity does not modify
the initiative roll in melee combat. However, it may modify
initiative in missile combat (see “Combat”).

| Dexterity | Surprise Bonus | Missile Bonus to Hit | AC Adjustment |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| 3         | -3             | -3                   | +4            |
| 4         | -2             | -2                   | +3            |
