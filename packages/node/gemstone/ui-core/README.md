Core UI and other front-end elements for the Gemstone application.

## Coordinate Systems
Gemstone uses three coordinate systems, and when working with components it is important to know which one is in play:

TODO: document how to convert between these

### World Coordinates
World coordinates represent locations in the virtual space of the game world, and have no direct relationship 
with any technological concepts like pixels, viewboxes, screen sizes, etc. All spatial information in the global
Gemstone model is stored and used as world coordinates.

### Canvas ("render scaled") Coordinates
The canvas coordinate system is a virtual coordinate space that is generated by transforming the world coordinate
space into an alternate, boundless set of coordinates for rendering. This is the coordinate space used by SVG elements
and viewboxes

The main purpose for this coordinate system is to allow the size in "SVG units" for various game elements to be scaled
as needed. This prevents, for example, situations where a tiny sprite isn't even large enough to be represented by a 
whole number coordinate the SVG.

### Viewport Coordinates
The viewport coordinate system is mapped to the physical display the game world is projected on. These coordinates have
a direct relationship with a browser window, fullscreen canvas, content area of a DOM element, etc.
